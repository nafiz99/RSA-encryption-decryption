Shift cipher or Caeser cipher is one of the most popular and widely known encyption techniques. I think this needs no further description. So, the algorithm is as follows-

Encryption:
f(p) = (p+k) mod 26

Decryption:
f(p') = (p'-k) mod 26

where, 
p= positional value of alphabet in the original message
p'= positional value of the alphabet in the encrypted message
k= key
